            <p> For those of you who are new to HTML and CSS, you will want to follow the instructions fairly closely. Those of you with more experience are welcome to explore more.  This lab will be graded entirely on submitting a <strong>valid</strong> HTML file and <strong>valid</strong> CSS file that show that some effort was put into this exercise.  This means that there is a lot of leeway in interpreting the instructions below.
            </p>
            
            <p>As we talked about in class, you will defintiely want to open up the developer tools in either <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#dom-and-styles">Chrome</a> or <a href=" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Open_the_Inspector">Firefox</a> as you are working.  We will not be directly checking for style at this point, but it would be a good habit to get into to follow a <a href=" https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml
">style guide.</a></p>
            
            <p>And if you are looking for some design inspiration talk to your TAs for suggestions of where to look</p>
            
            
            <h1>Lab 1: HTML and CSS</h1>
            <section>
                <h2 id="part1">Part 1: HTML</h2>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Make a copy of this html file and name it lab1.html.  You will be modifying your copy of this file.  While you are working on it, you will want to keep open this file, because it has links to some useful web pages.</li>
                    <li>While you are reading through the source of this file, note the use of semantic elements such as <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, and <code>nav</code>.  It is best practices to use semantic elements where ever possible rather than divs.  One important reason to do so is that it gives accessibility tools such as screen readers more information to make reading your page a better experience.</li>
                    <li>Add a navigation menu (using the <code>nav</code> element) to <code>lab1.html</code>that includes three items: anchor link to "Part 1: HTML", a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/struct/links.html#h-12.1.1">fragment</a> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">link</a> to "Part 2: CSS", and a real link with the label "HTML Reference" and the link "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/"
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a 2-by-4 HTML table after the end of this list, where the first column is the name of each of the four <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">pseudo-classes</a> on the anchor element, and the second column is the two or three word description of the pseudo-class (or state).</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 id="part2">Part 2: CSS</h2>
                <p>Add some style! You can choose colours, fonts and other things to style.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Add all CSS in a file called <code>styles.css</code> and link it in your <code>lab1.html</code> document. </li>
                    <li>Experiment with different styles for the table.</li>
                    <li>Add styles for the anchor tags for each of the four pseudo-classes.</li>
                    <li>Make the navigation menu appear on the left side of the content.  You may pick one of several approaches to do this: 
                    <ul> <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp">Basic using floating list items</a></li>           
                        <li>If you have more CSS knowledge, make the menu responsive using @media queries and no Javascript. </li>          
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>If you have prior CSS experience, try learning something new such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">css animations</a>, or something else you thought you might want to try.</li>
                </ol>
