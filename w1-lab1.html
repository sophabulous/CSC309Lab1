            <h1>Lab 1: HTML and CSS</h1>
            <section>
                <h1 id="part1">Part 1: HTML</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make a copy of this html file and name it lab1.html.  You will be modifying your copy of this file.  While you are working on it, you will want to keep open this file, because it has links to some useful web pages.</li>
                    <li>Add a navigation menu (using the <code>nav</code> element) to <code>lab1.html</code>that includes three items: a fragment link to "Part 1: HTML", a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/struct/links.html#h-12.1.1">fragment</a> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">link</a> to "Part 2: CSS", and a real link with the label "W3C html" and the link "http://www.w3schools.com/html/"
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a 2-by-4 HTML table after the end of this list, where the first column is the name of each of the four <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">pseudo-classes</a> on the anchor element, and the second column is the two or three word description of the pseudo-class (or state).</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1 id="part2">Part 2: CSS</h1>
                <p>Add some style! You can choose colours, fonts and other things to style.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Add all CSS in a file called <code>styles.css</code> and link it in your <code>lab1.html</code> document. </li>
                    <li>Experiment with different styles for the table.</li>
                    <li>Add styles for the anchor tags for each of the four pseudo-classes.</li>
                    <li>Make the navigation menu appear on the left side of the content.  You may pick one of several approaches to do this: 
                    <ul> <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp">Basic using floating list items</a></li>           
                        <li>If you have more CSS knowledge, make the menu responsive using @media queries and no Javascript. </li>          
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>If you have prior CSS experience, try learning something new such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flexbox</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">css animations</a>, or something else you thought you might want to try.</li>
                </ol>
